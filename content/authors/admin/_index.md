Srishti Badaya is an interdisciplinary researcher, trained as a chemical engineer, who is fascinated by fundamental problems in soft matter and fluid systems, as well as skilled in translational product design. She is especially proficient at mathematical and computional systems modelling. Srishti is also passionate about science communication and technology policy. Outside of work, she enjoys travelling (hiking in the Himalayas recently!), writing, dancing, brewing various drinks, designing unecessary infographics and slide decks, and tinkering around with various over-engineered gadgets. She has been toying with a recently-gifted harmonica, an old kalimba, and a keyboard, but has yet to present any musical skill.
