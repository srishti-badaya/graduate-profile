Srishti Badaya is an interdisciplinary researcher and learner, with a formal foundation in Chemical Engineering. She is interested in problems that bridge the gap between fundamental science and translational applications for soft matter and fluid systems, leveraging her strong mathematical and computational modelling background. Beyond her technical work, she is deeply passionate about the intersection of society and science, specifically through science communication and tech policy.

Offline, Srishti displays a love for 'productive procrastination,' often channeled into writing, designing elaborate slide decks, or tinkering with gadgets. Rooted in a childhood spanning 5 countries, she is an avid traveler (most recently hiking the Himalayas!) with a penchant for brewing various drinks from around the globe. Currently, she is trying her hand at the kalimba, keyboard, and a newly-gifted harmonica, though she has yet to produce a melody that is suitable for public consumption.
